# Performance

Measured, not guessed. Everything below came from `cargo bench` and
`cargo run --release -p slate-kernel --example perf_report` on a 4-core Xeon at
2.8 GHz; the absolute numbers will differ on your machine, the ratios should
not.

## How to reproduce

```sh
cargo bench                                                   # criterion
cargo run --release -p slate-kernel --example perf_report     # I/O counts
```

Two profiles are used. `free` charges nothing and isolates CPU. `io` charges
object-storage round trips — a millisecond per point read, one per scan and one
per 256-row block. Prefer the **I/O counts** over the clock: "this removed 500
point reads" survives a different machine, provider and timer; a wall-clock
figure from a simulated profile survives none of them.

Charges are at least a millisecond deliberately. The runtime timer has roughly
millisecond granularity, so a profile built from microseconds measures the timer
rather than the workload — the first version of this harness did exactly that
and reported a 20µs read as 1.3ms.

## Baseline

Recorded before any optimisation work, on 10,000 rows across 4 tenants, with
three secondary indexes.

### Query shapes, at object-storage cost

| query | rows | point reads | scans | wall | plan chosen |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| point get by primary key | 1 | 0 | 1 | 16 ms | table scan |
| whole tenant | 2500 | 0 | 1 | 36 ms | table scan |
| indexed equality | 100 | **100** | 1 | 231 ms | index `by_kind` |
| indexed equality, limit 10 | 10 | 10 | 1 | 43 ms | index `by_kind` |
| indexed range | 500 | **500** | 1 | **1099 ms** | index `by_at_desc` |
| unindexed filter | 0 | 0 | 1 | 37 ms | table scan |
| insert 1 row (3 indexes) | 1 | 1 | 0 | 6 ms | — |
| insert 100 rows, one txn | 100 | 100 | 0 | 221 ms | — |

### CPU only

| operation | time |
|---|---:|
| encode a 2-column primary key | 63 ns |
| the same, into a reused buffer | **19 ns** |
| decode a 2-column primary key | 61 ns |
| encode 6 columns | 176 ns |
| decode 6 columns | 384 ns |
| build a row key | 148 ns |
| plan a 3-term predicate | **1.04 µs** |
| point get, end to end | 830 ns |
| scan 2500 rows | 1.60 ms (640 ns/row) |
| index scan, 100 rows | 134 µs (1.34 µs/row) |
| insert 1 row, 3 indexes | 8.7 µs |

## What the baseline says

**An index scan costs one point read per row, and that dominates everything
else.** Returning 100 rows through an index costs 231 ms, while scanning the
whole 2500-row tenant costs 36 ms — the index is 6× *slower* while reading 25×
less data. At 500 rows the index scan takes 1.1 seconds against the same 36 ms.

**The planner has no idea this is true.** It picks an index whenever one matches
more equality terms, with no notion of how many rows that implies. On the 500-row
range that choice is 30× worse than ignoring the index. This is the largest
single defect the profile exposes and no amount of making the row lookup faster
fixes it.

**A primary-key lookup opens a scan rather than doing a point read.** Functionally
fine, needlessly indirect, and it means the cheapest possible query does not take
the cheapest possible path.

**Planning costs more than executing a point lookup** — 1.04 µs against 830 ns.
It clones the predicate into the residual and allocates a constraint list per
call, on every query.

**Key encoding is mostly allocation.** 63 ns to encode a two-column key, 19 ns
for the same bytes into a buffer that already exists. A write with three indexes
builds seven keys.

**Every insert does a read.** The duplicate-primary-key check costs a round trip
per row, so a 100-row load spends 100 of them before writing anything.

## Fixture notes

Two things in the harness were wrong before the numbers above were trustworthy,
and both flattered or distorted the results:

- `MemoryStore` copied the whole map on every `begin`, so any benchmark above a
  few hundred rows measured the copy. Snapshots are now shared by pointer.
- `MemoryStore::scan` copied the whole map and then filtered, making every scan
  O(database). Ranging the map directly took a 2500-row tenant scan from 14.5 ms
  to 1.6 ms — a 9× difference that was entirely fixture.

It is worth stating plainly that the first two "findings" from this harness were
both bugs in the harness.
